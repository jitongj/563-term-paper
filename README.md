# Bayesian Model Comparison for Mortality Forecasting
### Data
- **England and Wales (Females):**
  - `1x1EWdeath.txt`: Deaths classified by single year of age from 0 to 99, and years ranging from 1961 to 2002.
  - `1x1EWexposure.txt`: Exposure data corresponding to the above death data.
  - `1x1EWdeath_validation_correct.txt`: Corrected validation death data.
  - `1x1EWexposure_validation_correct.txt`: Corrected validation exposure data.

- **USA (Females):**
  - `1x1USA_Deaths.txt`: Deaths classified by single year of age from 0 to 99, and years ranging from 1961 to 2002.
  - `1x1USA_Exposures.txt`: Exposure data corresponding to the above death data.

### Code

- `Bayesian_model_compare_MF_Rcode_female.R`: R script for performing Bayesian model comparison and mortality forecasting for female data.
